The principle of superposition states that when two or more waves overlap in space, the resulting displacement at any point is the algebraic sum of the displacements of the individual waves at that point.

## Mathematical Expression
If y₁(x,t) and y₂(x,t) represent two waves, then the resultant wave y(x,t) is:
y(x,t) = y₁(x,t) + y₂(x,t)

## Key Applications
1. **Interference patterns**: When two coherent waves meet, they create patterns of constructive and destructive interference
2. **Standing waves**: Formed when two waves of the same frequency travel in opposite directions
3. **Wave packets**: Complex waveforms can be analyzed as a superposition of simpler waves

## Limitations
The principle applies only to linear wave equations. In non-linear media, the principle breaks down.

## Example
Sound waves from multiple sources combine according to the superposition principle, which is why we can hear different instruments in an orchestra simultaneously."""
    
    elif "dna replication" in question.lower():
        return """# DNA Replication Process

DNA replication is the biological process of producing two identical replicas of DNA from one original DNA molecule.

## Key Steps

1. **Initiation**:
   - Helicase unwinds the DNA double helix at origins of replication
   - Single-strand binding proteins stabilize the separated strands
   - Primase creates RNA primers on both strands

2. **Elongation**:
   - DNA polymerase III adds nucleotides to the growing strand
   - Leading strand: Continuous synthesis in 5' to 3' direction
   - Lagging strand: Discontinuous synthesis as Okazaki fragments
   - DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces with DNA
   - DNA ligase joins Okazaki fragments

3. **Termination**:
   - Replication ends when replication forks meet
   - Telomerase adds telomeres at chromosome ends (in eukaryotes)

## Key Enzymes
- Helicase: Unwinds DNA double helix
- Primase: Synthesizes RNA primers
- DNA polymerase III: Primary replication enzyme
- DNA polymerase I: Removes RNA primers
- DNA ligase: Joins Okazaki fragments

## Characteristics
- Semi-conservative: Each new DNA molecule contains one original and one new strand
- Bidirectional: Proceeds in both directions from origin
- Highly accurate: Error rate of approximately 1 in 10⁹ nucleotides"""
    
    elif "integration by parts" in question.lower():
        return """# Integration by Parts

Integration by parts is a technique used to find the integral of a product of functions.

## Formula
∫u(x)v'(x)dx = u(x)v(x) - ∫v(x)u'(x)dx

Where:
- u(x) and v'(x) are functions
- u'(x) is the derivative of u(x)
- v(x) is the antiderivative of v'(x)

## When to Use It
Integration by parts is most useful when:

1. **Products of functions**: When integrating a product of two functions
2. **Specific combinations**:
   - Products involving logarithms: ∫ln(x)dx
   - Products involving inverse trigonometric functions: ∫arctan(x)dx
   - Products of polynomials and exponentials: ∫xⁿe^x dx
   - Products of polynomials and trigonometric functions: ∫xⁿsin(x)dx

## LIATE Rule
When choosing which function to be u(x), the following order is often helpful:
- L: Logarithmic functions
- I: Inverse trigonometric functions
- A: Algebraic functions (polynomials)
- T: Trigonometric functions
- E: Exponential functions

## Example
To evaluate ∫x·cos(x)dx:
- Let u(x) = x and v'(x) = cos(x)
- Then u'(x) = 1 and v(x) = sin(x)
- ∫x·cos(x)dx = x·sin(x) - ∫sin(x)dx = x·sin(x) + cos(x) + C"""
