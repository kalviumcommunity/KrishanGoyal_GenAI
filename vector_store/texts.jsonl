A nucleotide has three components – a nitrogenous base, a\npentose sugar (ribose in case of RNA, and deoxyribose for DNA), and a\nphosphate group. There are two types of nitrogenous bases – Purines\n(Adenine and Guanine), and Pyrimidines (Cytosine, Uracil and Thymine).\nCytosine is common for both DNA and RNA and Thymine is present in\nDNA.

It was\nonly in 1953 that James Watson and Francis Crick, based on the X-ray\ndiffraction data produced by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin,\nproposed a very simple but famous Double Helix model for the structure\nof DNA.  One of the hallmarks of their proposition was base pairing between\nthe two strands of polynucleotide chains.

Also, if each strand from a DNA (let us call it as a\nparental DNA) acts as a template for synthesis of a new strand, the two\ndouble stranded DNA (let us call them as daughter DNA) thus, produced\nwould be identical to the parental DNA molecule.

There he observed\nan amazing diversity of creatures. Of particular interest, small black birds\nlater called Darwin’s Finches amazed him. He realised that there were many\nFigure 6.4 Figure showing white - winged moth and dark - winged moth (melanised)\non a tree trunk (a) In unpolluted area (b) In polluted area\n(a)\n(b)\nReprint 2025-26\n"}

This process of evolution of different\nspecies in a given geographical area starting from a point and literally\nradiating to other areas of geography (habitats) is called adaptive radiation.\nDarwin’s finches represent one of the best examples of this phenomenon.\nAnother example is Australian marsupials.

As these cells actively divide and grow they\nalso starve the normal cells by competing for vital nutrients. Cells sloughed\nfrom such tumors reach distant sites through blood, and wherever they\nget lodged in the body, they start a new tumor there. This property called\nmetastasis is the most feared property of malignant tumors.\nCauses of cancer : Transformation of normal cells into can"}

A common example is the production of\ncurd from milk. Micro-organisms such as Lactobacillus and others\ncommonly called lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grow in milk and convert it\nto curd.

{"text": "MATHEMATICS\n2\n1.2  Types of Relations\nIn this section, we would like to study different types of relations. We know that a\nrelation in a set A is a subset of A × A. Thus, the empty set φ and A × A are two\nextreme relations. For illustration, consider a relation R in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} given by\nR = {(a, b): a – b = 10}. This is the empty set, as no pair (a, b) satisfies the condition\na – b = 10. Similarly, R′ = {(a, b) : | a – b | ≥ 0} is the whole set A × A, as all pairs\n(a, b) in A × A satisfy | a – b | ≥ 0. These two extreme examples lead us to the\nfollowing definitions.\nDefinition 1 A relation R in a set A is called empty relation, if no element of A is\nrelated to any element of A, i.e., R = φ ⊂ A × A.\nDefinition 2  A relation R in a set A is called universal relation, if each ele"}

Show that the relation R\nin A given by R = {(a, b) : a is sister of b} is the empty relation and R′ = {(a, b) : the\ndifference between heights of a and b is less than 3 meters} is the universal relation.\nSolution Since the school is boys school, no student of the school can be sister of any\nstudent of the school. Hence, R = φ, showing that R is the empty relation. It is also\nobvious that the difference between heights of any two students of the school has to be\n"}

However, a relation R in the set {1, 2, 3, 4} defined by R\n= {(a, b) : b = a + 1} is also expressed as a R b if and only if\nb = a + 1 by many authors. We may also use this notation, as and when convenient.\nIf (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b and we denote it as a R b.\nOne of the most important relation, which plays a significant role in Mathematics,\nis an equivalence relation.

The next natural question is:\nIs there a function which grows faster than any polynomial function.

{"text": "Foreword\nThe National Curriculum Framework 2005, recommends that children’s life at school\nmust be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from\nthe legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap\nbetween the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to\ndiscourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different\nsubject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction\nof a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education\n(1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers\nwill take to encourage "}
{"text": "tion\n(1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers\nwill take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative\nactivities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom,\nchildren generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them\nby adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of\nthe key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating\ncreativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in\nlearning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.\nFlexibility in the daily time-table is as necessa"}

Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of\ncurricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.

A treatise on gambling\nnamed liber de Ludo Alcae, by Geronimo Carden (1501-1576) was published\nposthumously in 1663. In this treatise, he gives the number of favourable cases\nfor each event when two dice are thrown.\nGalileo (1564-1642) gave casual remarks concerning the correct evaluation\nof chance in a game of three dice. Galileo analysed that when three dice are\nthrown, the sum of the number that appear is more likely to be 10 than the sum 9,\nbecause the number of cases favourable to 10 are more than the number of\ncases for the appearance of number 9.\nApart from these early contributions, it is generally acknowledged that the\ntrue o"}

A French gambler, Chevalier de Metre asked Pascal to explain\nsome seeming contradiction between his theoretical reasoning and the\nobservation gathered from gambling.

The\ntwo strands of wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with which the rods were\nrubbed, also repel each other. However, the glass rod and wool attracted\neach other. Similarly, two plastic rods rubbed with cat’s fur repelled each\nother [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur.

There are two kinds of electrification and\nwe find  that (i) like charges repel and (ii) unlike charges attract each\nother.

They also do not attract or repel other light\nobjects as they did on being electrified.\nThus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged\nbodies are brought in contact. What can you conclude from these\nobservations? It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objects\nneutralise or nullify each other’s effect.

{"text": "Electric Charges\nand Fields\n3\nA simple apparatus to detect charge on a body is the gold-leaf\nelectroscope [Fig. 1.2(a)]. It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a\nbox, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged\nobject touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on to\nthe leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator of\nthe amount of charge.\nTry to understand why material bodies acquire charge. You know that\nall matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules. Although normally the\nmaterials are electrically neutral,  they do contain charges; but their charges\nare exactly balanced.

Thus the electric force is all pervasive and\nit encompasses almost each and every field associated with our life. It is\ntherefore essential that we learn more about such a force.\nTo electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of\ncharge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this\nexcess charge or deficit of charge. In solids,  some of the electrons, being\nless tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred\nfrom one body to the other.

When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of the\nelectrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth. Thus the rod gets\npositively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge is\ncreated in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that are\ntransferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the\nmaterial body.\n1.3  CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS\nSome substances readily allow passage of electricity through them, others\ndo not.

When an external force does work in taking a body from a\npoint to another against a force like spring force or gravitational force,\nthat work gets stored as potential energy of the body. When the external\nforce is removed, the body moves, gaining kinetic energy and losing\nan equal amount of potential energy. The sum of kinetic and\npotential energies is thus conserved. Forces of this kind are called\nconservative forces. Spring force and gravitational force are examples of\nconservative forces.\nCoulomb force between two (stationary) charges is also a conservative\nforce. This is not surprising, since both have inverse-square dependence\non distance and differ mainly in the proportionality constants "}

Second, in bringing the charge q from\nR to P, we apply an external force Fext just enough to\ncounter the repulsive electric force FE (i.e, Fext= –FE).\nThis means there is no net force on or acceleration of\nthe charge q when it is brought from R to P, i.e., it is\nbrought with infinitesimally slow constant speed.

Similarly, if the North-\npole of the magnet is being withdrawn from the coil, the magnetic flux\nthrough the coil will decrease.

{"text": "FOREWORD\nThe National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 recommends that children’s life at school must\nbe linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish\nlearning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and\ncommunity. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement\nthis basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly\nfurther in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on\nEducation (NPE), 1986.\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to"}

{"text": "Chapter Nine\nRAY OPTICS\nAND OPTICAL\nINSTRUMENTS\n9.1  INTRODUCTION\nNature has endowed the human eye (retina) with the sensitivity to detect\nelectromagnetic waves within a small range of the electromagnetic\nspectrum. Electromagnetic radiation belonging to this region of the\nspectrum (wavelength of about 400 nm to 750 nm) is called light. It is\nmainly through light and the sense of vision that we know and interpret\nthe world around us.\nThere are two things that we can intuitively mention about light from\ncommon experience. First, that it travels with enormous speed and second,\nthat it travels in a straight line. It took some time for people to realise that\nthe speed of light is finite and measurable.

The speed of light in vacuum is the highest\nspeed attainable in nature.\nThe intuitive notion that light travels in a straight line seems to\ncontradict what we have learnt in Chapter 8, that light is an\nelectromagnetic wave of wavelength belonging to the visible part of the\nspectrum. How to reconcile the two facts? The answer is that the\nwavelength of light is very small compared to the size of ordinary objects\nthat we encounter commonly (generally of the order of a few cm or larger).\nIn this situation, as you will learn in Chapter 10, a light wave can be\nconsidered to travel from one point to another, along a straight line joining\nRatio"}

They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas.

Similarly,\nthe chapter on communications has been substantially curtailed. It has been rewritten\nin an easily comprehensible form.\nAlthough most other chapters have been based on the earlier versions, several parts\nand sections in them have been rewritten.

{"text": "itten. The Development Team has been guided by\nthe feedback received from innumerable teachers across the country.\nIn producing these books, Class XI as well as Class XII, there has been a basic\nchange of emphasis. Both the books present physics to students without assuming\nthat they would pursue this subject beyond the higher secondary level. This new view\nhas been prompted by the various observations and suggestions made in the National\nCurriculum Framework (NCF), 2005. Similarly, in today’s educational scenario where\nstudents can opt for various combinations of subjects, we cannot assume that a physics\nstudent is also studying mathematics. Therefore, physics has to be presented, so to\nsay, in a stand-alone form.\nAs in Class XI textbook, some interesting box items have been inserted in m"}

Their purpose is to catch\nthe attention of the reader, to show some applications in daily life or in other areas of\nscience and technology, to suggest a simple experiment, to show connection of concepts\nin different areas of physics, and in general, to break the monotony and enliven the\nbook.\nFeatures like Summary, Points to Ponder, Exercises and Additional Exercises at\nthe end of each chapter, and Examples have been retained.

They will find almost always that the question ‘why’ has no answer within the domain\nof physics and science in general. But that itself is a learning experience, is it not? On\nthe other hand, the question ‘how’ has been reasonably well answered by physicists in\nthe case of most natural phenomena. In fact, with the understanding of how things\nhappen, it has been possible to make use of many phenomena to create technological\napplications for the use of humans.\nRationalised 2023-24\n"}

You will realise that it is not possible to answer ‘why’. This question\nbelongs to the domain of philosophy or metaphysics. But we can answer ‘how’, we can\nfind the force acting, we can find the wavelength of the photon (or electron), we can\ndetermine how things behave under different conditions, and we can develop instruments\nwhich will use these phenomena to our advantage.\nIt has been a pleasure to work for these books at the higher secondary level, along\nwith a team of members.
