# Chain of Thought Prompting

Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that encourages language models to break down complex problems into intermediate steps before arriving at an answer. This approach significantly improves performance on reasoning tasks while providing transparent explanations that users can follow.

## What is Chain of Thought Prompting?

Chain of Thought prompting involves explicitly asking the model to "think step by step" or by providing examples that demonstrate a step-by-step reasoning process. This technique is particularly valuable for:

- Mathematical problems
- Logical reasoning
- Scientific explanations
- Complex multi-step processes
- Educational content where understanding the process is as important as the answer

## Benefits of Chain of Thought

1. **Improved Reasoning**: Breaking complex problems into steps reduces errors in reasoning
2. **Transparency**: Users can follow the model's thought process and identify potential errors
3. **Educational Value**: Shows the reasoning process, not just the final answer
4. **Verifiability**: Makes it easier to check if the reasoning is sound and the answer is correct
5. **Step-by-Step Learning**: Helps students understand problem-solving methodologies

## Token Usage Considerations

Chain of Thought prompting typically results in longer responses and therefore consumes more tokens than standard prompting. Our testing shows:

- CoT responses use approximately 150-200% more output tokens
- The increase in total token usage is typically 100-150%
- Input tokens may increase slightly due to the additional prompt instructions

This increased token usage represents a tradeoff between cost/efficiency and improved reasoning quality.

## Implementation in Our System

Our system implements Chain of Thought prompting by:

1. Adding explicit instructions to "think step by step" in the prompt
2. Structuring the response with markdown headings for each reasoning step
3. Tracking token usage to evaluate the cost-benefit tradeoff
4. Allowing easy comparison with standard prompting approaches

## Examples

### Mathematics Problem:

"Solve the integral of x^2 \* ln(x) dx."

### Physics Problem:

"A 5kg object falls from a height of 20m. Calculate its kinetic energy just before hitting the ground."

### Chemistry Problem:

"Balance the chemical equation: Fe + O2 â†’ Fe2O3"

### Logic Problem:

"If all A are B, and some B are C, what can we conclude about the relationship between A and C?"

## When to Use Chain of Thought Prompting

Use Chain of Thought prompting when:

- The problem requires multi-step reasoning
- Educational context demands showing the process
- Complex mathematical or scientific questions are involved
- Accuracy is more important than token efficiency
- Users need to verify the reasoning process
